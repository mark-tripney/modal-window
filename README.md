# Modal Window Picture Viewer

This exercise in DOM manipulation allows the user to view larger images in a modal window (the images are taken from **Picsum**). If the user wishes to close the window, they can either click _outside_ the image or press the Escape key.

## To-do

- Fix stutter caused by modal viewer opening before image has loaded.
